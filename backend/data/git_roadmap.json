These snapshots let you:\n\n- Go back to any previous version\n- See exactly what changed and when\n- Work with others without overwriting each other's work\n\nImagine writing a document and being able to see every version you ever saved, who changed what, and restore any of them instantly. That's Git.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n- **Repository (repo)**: A folder where Git tracks your files\n- **Commit**: A saved snapshot of your project\n- **History**: The timeline of all your commits\n\nGit lives on your computer. It doesn't need the internet. GitHub (which we'll cover later) is a website where you can store and share your Git projects.",
